# 🧪 Python Practice Notebooks

This repository is a collection of **Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`)** where I practice and explore Python programming. It covers a range of topics from basics to intermediate-level problems, including hands-on examples, mini-projects, and usage of external libraries.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 📦 Requirements

Install dependencies using pip if not already available:

```bash
pip install notebook numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn requests
```

Or use:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### ▶️ Running the Notebooks

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-practice.git
